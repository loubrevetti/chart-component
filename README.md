    ```

  * data model assumption ```records[{'address':'11 main st', 'city':'wolcott', 'state':'CT', 'zipcode':'06489}]```
  
5. *please note* **voya-chart** *instaniates the chart component object, in order to display a chart you must instaniate the chart component with a chart type attribute other wise chart cannot understand how to render. table below lists out different chart types, each type will ist out individual properties related to that chart class.*
    
6. **Also Please note in order to access the chart objects api you will have to target the api property of the rendered DOM component very important, to alter any properties you should listen to the eventBUs in the api property on chart object**
       ```
        let chart = document.querySelector('voya-chart')
        chart.api.eventBus.on('rendered',function(){
          chart.api.legend={position:'left'}
        })
